            Our mission is to provide quality service to our clients and carriers,
            while upholding a high level of integrity. Transporting commodities
            throughout the country safely and in a timely fashion shouldn't be
            considered a bonus, but should be a baseline standard. This is our
            standard and we strive to make transporting goods a painless
            experience for the clients and carriers we work with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here at Crosswind Logistics we maintain close relationships with
            established carriers to provide our clients with fast response times
            and reliable goods transportation services. When we work with new
            carriers, we take a close look at their records and avoid ones which
            fall outside our standards for safety and responsibility.
            Carriers must meet the safety standards and regulations developed by
            the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), on top of our
            own internal vetting process.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are times when unforseen events can happen, such as bad weather,
            accidents or other unavoidable scenarios. When these events happen, we
            make sure to keep everyone informed and work hard to correct the issues
            at hand. We pride ourselves in being good problem solvers. We're straight
            shooters and have seen many difficult and interesting situations through
            to the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you are a possible new client looking to have goods delivered
            or a carrier looking for goods to transport, we'll work hard to get
            the job done. Take a look at the services section to learn more about
            what we offer. If you have any questions, you can email us directly
            from the inqueries section.

          <p>
            Our primary service offering is locating dependable delivery methods
            for clients. We are connected to a deep network of freight carriers
            and thus can offer the specifc type of truck a client may need:
            flatbeds, vans, reefers, or anything in-between.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our services don't stop at finding our clients a truck. We keep track
            of trucks and keep our clients informed of their delivery progress.
            We make sure to be on top of service hours at shipping and receiving
            locations and make appointments for loading or unloading when
            necessary. We like everyone to be on the same page. This standard
            helps us solve problems quickly, maintain constant delivery success,
            and keep our clients and carriers operating efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have several years of industry and seasonal expertise that enable
            us to make educated decisions and operate efficiently. We work with
            our clients and carriers to get the best rates, making sure everyone
            walks away from a delivery getting not only quality service, but fair
            pay as well.
