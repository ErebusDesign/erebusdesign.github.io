				<h3>Erebus Weekly - Week 02 - 03.03.2017</h3>
				<p>
					Welcome to the Erebus Weekly, Week 02. There wasn't a terrible amount of excitement this week,
					more on the boring documentation and organizing side of things.
				</p>

				<div class='spacer'></div>

				<h5>THIS</h5>
				<p>
					Again, <i>this</i>. Previously the Erebus Design site and The Weekly here were hosted on some
					crappy free host, that fails to update inode counts properly. Thus, I wasn't actually able to
					get any of the ED site stuff uploaded. This forced my hand (gently, mind you) to get on the GitHub
					wagon (swidt?). Now there is an <a href="https://github.com/ErebusDesign" target="_blank">Erebus
					Design organization</a>, as well as the associated <a href="https://erebusdesign.github.io/"
					target="_blank">GitHub Pages set up</a>. Wait, you're already here...	Moving on.
				</p>

				<h5>Documentation, Anyone?</h5>
				<p>
					I both love and hate documentation. At least, my brain does. Sometimes it just takes off, without
					a leash, other times I can't get it to do one damn trick when company is over. At any rate, more
					documentation for Cogitatio and EGT was worked on. There <i>should</i> be documentation efforts
					for Ultra Puck Battle underway, but that probably won't happen. That'll just float around in my
					spacious noggin.
				</p>

				<h5>YouTube Famous</h5>
				<p>
					One can dream. Concept for the Erebus Design YouTube channel is being conceptualized. Yeah, that's
					right. Concept being concepted. Basically, we've identified the need (desire) for a front on YouTube,
					to show off our pretties. Tutorials and such may also end up there, but again- concept stages.
				</p>

				<h5>Closing Time</h5>
				<p>
					Short and sweet this week. Plans for future entries include tips n' tricks, cool links, and gratuitis
					use of sloth emojis. Stay tuned. Out.
