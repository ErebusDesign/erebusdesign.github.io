				<h3>Erebus Weekly - Week 003 - 03.10.2017</h3>
				<p>
					Welcome to the Erebus Weekly, Week 003. More work on the backend over here. We set up a subversion
					server and have "skeletons" set up for the EGT and Cogitatio projects. This will be a bit of a
					boost in efficiency and help us stay on the same page when development starts picking up more on
					these projects.
				</p>

				<h5>EGT Updates</h5>
				<p>
					There wasn't a massive amount of progress with EGT, though some tweaks were made to the character
					camera system. Switching between first and third person cameras and zooming when in third
					person feels a little smoother now. Some concept groundwork was laid down for environment
					interactions, though with some forward thinking, I decided it best to get a few other
					systems (that will be interactable) up and running to make sure interactions are more "generic"
					and not so project specific. More on that later...
				</p>

				<h5>MORE Documentation?</h5>
				<p>
					Yeah... Well, sorta. Some older documentation was scrapped and current docs edited. Pretty soon
					we need to develop an in-house style guide for documentation, and lay down a template. I think
					this will aid in both cleaner and more concise documentation, as well as act as a guide for actual
					project development. You wouldn't think documentation would drive a project, but when you read over
					an overview you can sometimes spot things that just don't make sense within a project. It's like
					taking a second look at things, with a new angle from a different story of the building. Or reviewing.
				</p>

				<h5>That's All Folks</h5>
				<p>
					Another simple week. A lot of articles were read, GDC talks watched, new tools checked out... Things
					that aren't necessarily exciting content within a progress report, but all elements that contribute
					to forward momentum, nonetheless. Catch ya next week, where we examine the rising issue of penguin
					dandriff.
