				<h3>Erebus Weekly - Week 01 - 02.24.2017</h3>
				<p>
					Welcome to the Erebus Weekly, Week 01. Quite a few random things were accomplished this week,
					mostly getting organized (not much to <i>see</i> here), but also a few handy assets were
					developed. I'll just jump right into it...
				</p>

				<div class='spacer'></div>

				<h5>THIS</h5>
				<p>
					Yeah, literally, <i>this</i>. Developed the HTML/CSS and other assets for the Erebus Weekly, as
					well as whipping up Week 01's entry! The Erebus Weekly will	be useful for tracking our progress
					and keeping our community (do we even have one?) up to date.
				</p>

				<h5>Internal Organization (giggity)</h5>
				<p>
					Lot's of organization on the backend (giggity again), with a lot more to do yet. Various assets,
					projects, etc. were pruned or archived, while current and actual useful stuff was organized better.
					Tons of resources were updated or at the least, cleaned up to be easier to use. Too much to list,
					and it wouldn't really affect anyone outside of my crazy OCD ass anyhow. Just know that this bit
					will help efficiency AND sanity.
				</p>

				<h5>ED Logo Love</h5>
				<p>
					A little bit of kindness was imparted on the Erebus Design logo. We now have 4 sizes available
					for quick cheating (copy/paste) into our designs: 256px, 128px, 96px, and 48px. There was a
					64px version as well, but he ran away with the spoon. <a href="week_01_assets/ed_logo_preview.png" target="_blank">
					Check it out.</a>
				</p>

				<h5>MatCap Studio</h5>
				<p>
					Utilizing blender and pent up rage, a nifty matcap generation pipeline was created. MatCap stands
					for "material capture", and is a way to quickly get visual feedback about the surface of your 3D
					models. Rather than having to calculate lighting and reflections, this data is approximated
					(faked, rather) using a generated matcap image.
					<a href="week_01_assets/matcap_001.png" target="_blank">Here is an example of a matcap</a>. Also,
					<a href="week_01_assets/matcap_ss_overview.png" target="_blank">here a screenshot</a> of a bunch
					of monkey heads with some of the matcaps generated.
				</p>
				<p>
					As well as that matcap generation thingy developed for blender, a slick material for utilizing
					those matcaps was created in Unreal Engine. For the most part, the result is 1:1 with what you
					see in blender, sRGB and tonemapping aside. This (growing) library of matcaps will be useful
					for modeling/sculpting, debugging, and blockout sessions. Also, a blueprint actor was developed
					for easier showcasing of the matcap library. <a href="week_01_assets/egt_matcap_bp.jpg" target="_blank">
					Here's a screenshot of that</a>. Suzanne rotates and the matcaps cycle through at tweakable rates. Cool.
				</p>

				<h5>EGT Rework (part 7.3)</h5>
				<p>
					Don't be thrown off by that title. It's total bullshit. EGT (Erebus Game Template) however, is not
					total bullshit. A cleaner base was built as a jumpoff (I'm actually starting to call EGT a boilerplate)
					for UE projects. Here is a bulleted list of <i>some</i> of the magic (because both magic and bulleted
					lists are awesome):
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Sane and optimized editor/project settings</li>
					<li>Useful plugins compiled (for 4.15), tested and included</li>
					<li>Character controller with 1st and 3rd person camera</li>
					<li>Base for various systems initialized</li>
					<li>Core/common materials initialized</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Now, there is still a hell of a lot to do with EGT before we can call it a stable boilerplate for our UE
					projects, but even now, it's a nice fast start with some common settings and plugins already set up for us.
					In the future, this efficiency will rise with the addition of more tools and assets that are commonly used
					or just very helpful. More on that in some other area. It's simply too much to go into for the Weekly.
				</p>

				<h5>UPB Action</h5>
				<p>
					Ultra Puck Battle got some attention this week as well, dealing mostly with organization. Having moved the
					whole toolset over to a completely free and/or open source ecosphere caused a bit of havoc. Good havoc,
					though! Outside	of our launch platform (Steam, itch.io, etc) and Unreal Engine licensing/royalty costs, we
					won't have any fees to worry about. The idea of having to pay for so many little tools based on our success
					and all that jazz, is a serious headache. Well, that headache is now gone. Yay!
				</p>
				<p>
					The various systems/controllers that build up a brunt of UPB have been further optimized and organized as
					well, particularly in the way they communicate with each other and the various pieces in the game (such as
					the paddles, puck, etc). It is now possible for any blueprint to get the frequency values from the audio
					controller,	simply by adding a component and fetching the frequency structure (or individual float values).
				</p>
				<p>
					The arena design has had a makeover, yet again. This is due to moving over to blender, mostly. The final
					<i>vision</i> for the arena is baked in, it's getting the actual assets produced that is taking so much
					time. One of the concepts being put to work, are <b>arena detail elements</b>, or an ADE for quick internal
					nerdiness. An ADE has a specific size constraint, with (currently) 3 sizes: small, medium, large. An ADE
					has a mount point and default transformation, allowing for an ADE to be placed in the arena at corresponding
					ADE mount points.
				</p>
				<p>
					An example might be a light, a small light to be precise. The model and it's orientation are built to
					specification for a small ADE, and an ADE blueprint will reference this mesh. Now the arena controller will
					know of all the available small, medium and large ADEs, and will procedurally place ADEs at corresponding
					points in the arena. We can also manually specify ADEs at mount points in the arena, of course. This system
					will allow for faster arena design when we start working on new and/or alternate versions of the arena.
				</p>
				<p>
					On of the ADEs developed for testing while developing this system, was a sound visualizer of sorts, meant
					to represent a futuristic subwoofer. Feeding off the sub-bass frequency, it bumps a holographic effect to
					the beat. This ADE was a large type, and the plan is to develop medium and small "speakers" in the same
					style for the other 6 frequencies. <a href="week_01_assets/upb_ade_demo.gif" target="_blank">Here is an
					animated GIF</a> of	that ADE. Note that the holographic bump distance, colors, etc are all tweakable.
				</p>

				<h5>Closing Time</h5>
				<p>
					Well that about wraps this week up. There were plenty of other little bits and bobs that were created or
					worked on, but those things are still too young or not at a level worth talking about or showing off yet.
					Rest assured that they will find their way into future Weekly entries. We have plenty more magic and gold to
					produce! Until next time...
